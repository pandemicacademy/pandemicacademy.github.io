"WWFGLDAZ","document","","Squazzoni, Flaminio; Bravo, Giangiacomo; Grimaldo, Francisco; Garcia-Costa, Daniel; Farjam, Mike; Bahar, Mehmani","Gender Gap in Journal Submissions and Peer Review During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic. A study on 2329 Elsevier journals","","","","","","During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unusually high submission rate of scholarly articles. Given that most academics were forced to work from home, the competing demands for familial duties may have penalized the scientific productivity of women. To test this hypothesis, we looked at submitted manuscripts and peer review activities for all Elsevier journals between February and May 2018-2020, including data on over 5 million authors and referees. Results showed that during the first wave of the pandemic, women submitted proportionally fewer manuscripts than men. This deficit was especially pronounced among more junior cohorts of women academics. The rate of the peer-review invitation acceptance showed a less pronounced gender pattern with women taking on a greater service responsibility for journals, except for health & medicine, the field where the impact of COVID-19 research has been more prominent. Our findings suggest that the first wave of the pandemic has created potentially cumulative advantages for men.","","2021-10-27 13:00:56","2021-10-27 13:03:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/jeremy/Zotero/storage/4XGCP2W4/Squazzoni et al. - Gender Gap in Journal Submissions and Peer Review .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global scientific conferences and individual laboratories and required people to find space in their homes from which to work. It blurred the boundaries between work and non-work, infusing ambiguity into everyday activities. While adaptations that allowed people to connect became more common, the evidence available at the end of 2020 suggests that the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic endangered the engagement, experience, and retention of women in academic STEMM, and may roll back some of the achievement gains made by women in the academy to date.","2021","2021-09-28 00:43:12","2021-09-28 00:46:02","","194","","","","","","","","","","","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine","Washington, DC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rogers grounds practical career advice in a nuanced consideration of the current landscape of the academic workforce. Drawing on surveys, interviews, and personal experience, Rogers explores the evolving rhetoric and practices regarding career preparation and how those changes intersect with admissions practices, scholarly reward structures, and academic labor practices—especially the increasing reliance on contingent labor. Rogers invites readers to consider how graduate training can lead to meaningful and significant careers beyond the academy. She provides graduate students with context and analysis to inform the ways they discern their own potential career paths while taking an activist perspective that moves toward individual success and systemic change. For those in positions to make decisions in humanities departments or programs, Rogers outlines the circumstances and pressures that students face and gives examples of programmatic reform that address career matters in structural ways. Throughout, Rogers highlights the important possibility that different kinds of careers offer engaging, fulfilling, and even unexpected pathways for students who seek them out.","2020-08-07","2021-09-27 18:27:05","2021-09-27 18:27:05","","","184","","","","","Putting the Humanities PhD to Work","","","","","Duke University Press Books","Durham","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Humanities-PhD-Work-Classroom/dp/1478009543/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=katina+rogers&qid=1632767216&s=books&sr=1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Haraway offers provocative new ways to reconfigure our relations to the earth and all its inhabitants. She eschews referring to our current epoch as the Anthropocene, preferring to conceptualize it as what she calls the Chthulucene, as it more aptly and fully describes our epoch as one in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked in tentacular practices. The Chthulucene, Haraway explains, requires sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis, or self-making. Learning to stay with the trouble of living and dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building more livable futures. Theoretically and methodologically driven by the signifier SF—string figures, science fact, science fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, so far—Staying with the Trouble further cements Haraway's reputation as one of the most daring and original thinkers of our time.","2016-09-19","2021-09-22 12:45:03","2021-09-22 12:45:03","","","312","","","","","Staying with the Trouble","","","","","Duke University Press Books","Durham","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Staying-Trouble-Chthulucene-Experimental-Futures/dp/0822362244","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Illustrated edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Academia once consisted largely of men in traditional single-earner families. Today, men and women fill the doctoral student ranks in nearly equal numbers and most will experience both the benefits and challenges of living in dual-income households. This generation also has new expectations and values, notably the desire for flexibility and balance between careers and other life goals. However, changes to the structure and culture of academia have not kept pace with young scholars’ desires for work-family balance. Do Babies Matter? is the first comprehensive examination of the relationship between family formation and the academic careers of men and women. The book begins with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, moves on to early and mid-career years, and ends with retirement. Individual chapters examine graduate school, how recent PhD recipients get into the academic game, the tenure process, and life after tenure. The authors explore the family sacrifices women often have to make to get ahead in academia and consider how gender and family interact to affect promotion to full professor, salaries, and retirement. Concrete strategies are suggested for transforming the university into a family-friendly environment at every career stage.The book draws on over a decade of research using unprecedented data resources, including the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, a nationally representative panel survey of PhDs in America, and multiple surveys of faculty and graduate students at the ten-campus University of California system..","2013-06-13","2021-09-17 14:21:49","2021-09-17 14:21:49","","","188","","","","","Do Babies Matter?","","","","","Rutgers University Press","New Brunswick, N.J","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Do-Babies-Matter-Gender-Families/dp/0813560802","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use 2014 data from a large national survey of faculty at more than 140 institutions as well as 2012 data from an online annual performance reporting system for tenured and tenure–track faculty at two campuses of a large public, Midwestern University. We find evidence in both data sources that, on average, women faculty perform significantly more service than men, controlling for rank, race/ethnicity, and field or department. Our analyses suggest that the male–female differential is driven more by internal service—i.e., service to the university, campus, or department—than external service—i.e., service to the local, national, and international communities—although significant heterogeneity exists across field and discipline in the way gender differentials play out.","2017-09-01","2021-09-17 14:21:43","2021-09-17 14:21:43","2020-06-25 19:01:06","672-694","","6","58","","Res High Educ","Faculty Service Loads and Gender","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/jeremy/Zotero/storage/R92YTRSF/Guarino and Borden - 2017 - Faculty Service Loads and Gender Are Women Taking.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study leverages this exogenous event to test key theoretical explanations of couples’ divisions of domestic labor. Using novel data from 1,025 partnered, different-sex US parents, our analysis shows an overall increase in domestic responsibilities for mothers, who were already doing most of the household labor, as well as an increase in fathers’ contributions. Driven by increases in fathers’ time spent on housework and childcare, we find that both mothers and fathers report a general shift toward more egalitarian divisions of household labor. Consistent with a time availability perspective, the findings indicate the relevance of increased time at home —due to unemployment, reduced work hours, and telecommuting— as a fundamental factor underlying change in parents’ division of domestic responsibilities.","2020-05-06","2021-09-17 14:21:18","2021-09-17 14:21:18","2020-09-11 13:22:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","osf.io","","Publisher: SocArXiv","","/Users/jeremy/Zotero/storage/DA7THME6/Carlson et al. - 2020 - US Couples’ Divisions of Housework and Childcare d.pdf; /Users/jeremy/Zotero/storage/XDNI2PSY/jy8fn.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This scarcity is most pronounced at the level of full professor. Why are women and faculty of color not reaching the upper levels of academia? Previous research in the cultural taxation literature suggests that women and faculty of color experience heavier service burdens than their white male colleagues. In order to examine whether a heavier service burden could be at the root of the “leaky pipeline” from Ph.D. to full professor among women and faculty of color, we recruited faculty in five departments at a large research university to record their daily tasks in time-use journals during two different weeks in a 10- week quarter. Our analysis of these journals provided mixed results with regard to gender, but pointed to important differences with regard to other axes of inequality. Specifically, we found that faculty of color, queer faculty, and faculty from working class backgrounds together spent a disproportionate amount of their time on the “invisible” work of academia, leaving them less time for the work that matters for tenure and promotion.","2017","2021-09-17 14:20:45","2021-09-17 14:20:45","2020-06-25 18:56:24","228-245","","","39","","","The Burden of Invisible Work in Academia","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Department of Sociology, Humboldt State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1,893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women’s representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020.

"778Z2XXA","report","2020","Alon, Titan; Doepke, Matthias; Olmstead-Rumsey, Jane; Tertilt, Michèle","The Impact of COVID-19 on Gender Equality","","","","","http://www.nber.org/papers/w26947.pdf","The economic downturn caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak has substantial implications for gender equality, both during the downturn and the subsequent recovery. Compared to “regular” recessions, which affect men’s employment more severely than women’s employment, the employment drop related to social distancing measures has a large impact on sectors with high female employment shares. In addition, closures of schools and daycare centers have massively increased child care needs, which has a particularly large impact on working mothers. The effects of the crisis on working mothers are likely to be persistent, due to high returns to experience in the labor market. Beyond the immediate crisis, there are opposing forces which may ultimately promote gender equality in the labor market. First, businesses are rapidly adopting flexible work arrangements, which are likely to persist.
